# Pytorch InceptionV3 model for CUB Classification using iNat pretrained model


The model is converted from tensorflow implmentation of work
Large Scale Fine-Grained Categorization and Domain-Specific Transfer Learning (https://github.com/richardaecn/cvpr18-inaturalist-transfer)


Model architecture is defined in myinception.py

Trained pytorch can be found here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VHcS2o0aYtr1MkYQP_uRgEGcM9bIcM_E/view
